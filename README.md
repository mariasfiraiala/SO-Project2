# Preemptive Scheduler - Project2

## Descripiton

The project aims to simulate a naive preemptive scheduler that would apply the Round Robin algorithm and manage a one core processor, ergo, besides our scheduler's thread, only one other thread should be running at a moment of time.
Implementation follows the sequence of events:

1. `so_init`: initialize the scheduler with default values, prepare the priority queue and the array of threads that would mantain them until the final step

**Not SO fun fact**: Our priority queue data structure of choice is a resizeable array, that would double its capacity.
Its initial dimension is 16 (a power of 2), therefore the multiplying operation is being performed faster (what should be called, "optimizare la constantÄƒ").

2. `so_fork`: fork threads, get them in the queue and in the internal array of threads

**Not SO fun fact**: By placing the insertion of threads in 2 different functions, we've achieved a cleaner look for `so_fork`.

3. `so_wait`: block the thread that starts interacting with an io event

4. `so_signal`: wake up all threads waiting for the respons of an io device

5. `so_exec`: simulate running the thread, each call mirrors instructions made during a clock interval

**Not SO fun fact**: This function made me lose the most braincells, having understand what really means simulating threads over system ones was though, however it brought the most joy in the end.

6. `so_end`: join all threads (from our internal thread array) and free them

**Note**: So far, we've used `DIE` in order to signal various allocation or function return failures, however a more suitable approach would be to use `goto` and not immediately terminate our program.

## Observations Regarding the Project

Interesting project however made me feel like the stupidest person ever; got me questioning my reasoning (for choosing UPB) and my knowledge regarding scheduling.

I guess it did its job right, as I definetely understand threads and synchronization a lot more.
